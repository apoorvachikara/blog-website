Javascript is one of the most popular languages these days. More and more people are learning and coding in it, but how it works remain the question. So, I though to write a blog series where I can help Javascript developers of any experience/freshers to understand the working in a very simple way and effective way. 

### How Javascript works?

There are different flavours available to JS engine like **V8 (Chrome), SpiderMonkey (Mozilla), JScript .NET, Carakan (opera)** and many more. So, we need to understand the working of every engine? No, in my perspective, if you learn to drive one car, you can drive almost any car available. 


It depends upon the flavour of JS engine we use, however, the elementary working of JS reamins same in every engine meaning the core parts are almost similar to each other (just different terminologies used).

### The History 

The world first browser with GUI, **Mosiac** was released in 1993. It played a prominent role in making popular WWW popular. In 1994, the lead developers of **Mosiac** founded **Netscape Corporation** and release more polished browser **Netscape Navigator**.  

In 1995, Netscape decided to add a scripting language to NetScape Navigator. They were willing to choose two routes to achieve this: collaborating with Sun Microsystems to embed the Java programming language, while also hiring **Brendan Eich** to embed the Scheme language. However, Soon they decided to go with **Eich** to devise a new language with syntax similar to Java and less like Scheme or other extant scripting languages.

The new lnaguage and its nterpreter is called **LiveScript** and first shipped with Navigator in 1995, September.

Later the name was changed to **Javascript** in December, the main reason was to make name confusing with already famous langauge **Java** and it acted as the marketing ploy by Netscape and it worked well!!
