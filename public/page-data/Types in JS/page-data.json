All programming languages have some built-in types and data structures. In this article, I will attempt to cover the types and related interview questions.</p>\n<p>When we talk about a <strong>dynamic typed language</strong>, <strong>JS</strong> is one of the first languages that comes to mind. Of course there are alot of others too, but we will be focusing on JS only.</p>\n<p>Variables are not directly assigned to any specific type, and any variable can be assigned or reassigned values of all types, you are not bound to any specific type. Following are the examples:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">let foo = “bar”;\nfoo = 29;\nfoo = undefined  </code></pre></div>\n<p>All these statements are valid in JS context. However, it is important to know what types are being natively defined by the language. Having a thorough understanding of each type and their behaviour is extremely essential to convert values to different types, it is known as coercion(will be covered in its own blog).</p>\n<h2>Javascript Types</h2>\n<p>There are built-in types provided by the language and it is called primitive types. However, it is feasible to create some types using a <strong>new</strong> operator, we will be discussing it after a few paragraphs.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">    null\n    undefined\n    boolean\n    number\n    string\n    bigint\n    symbol (ES6 onwards)</code></pre></div>\n<p>All these types are called primitives and you can use <strong>typeof</strong> operator to inspect the type of any value which returns any one of the seven values specific above.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">typeof undefined // “undefined”\ntypeof “hello world” // “string”\ntypeof 1111 // number\ntypeof false // boolean\ntypeof {“foo” : “bar”} // “object”\ntypeof BigInt(1234) // “bigint”\ntypeof Symbol() // “symbol”</code></pre></div>\n<p>You might have noticed why I haven’t included the type null in the above examples because its <em>special</em>.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">typeof null // “object” → why is that!!!</code></pre></div>\n<p>If it is a primitive type, it should have returned <em>null</em>? This is a bug in JS, yes, and it has been there for more than two decades and seems will never be fixed. A lot of web software might be dependent on this and it will create a lot more bugs. So, how do we check if the value is null or not?</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">let a = null;\nif (!a &amp;&amp; typeof a === “object”) console.log(`Yes, ${a} is null!`);</code></pre></div>\n<p>Note: <strong>null</strong> is the only primitive type which is falsy(it is evaluated false in conditions), but returns as “object”. I will cover falsy and truthy values later in this blog</p>\n<p>== Define every Type\n== Why to use string literal and object</p>\n<h2>Interview questions on Types</h2>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">1) What is the o/p of below code?\n\n```\ntypeof typeof false // “string”\n```</code></pre></div>\n<p>When we run first <strong>typeof</strong>, it returns the value <strong>”boolean”</strong>. Now, the ypeof\n<strong>”boolean”</strong> will return string as it is quoted in the string(typeof return value is of type\nstring).</p>\n<p>What is the o/p of below code?</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">typeof NaN // “number”\ntypeof infinity // “number”\ntypeof [1, 2, 4] // “object”</code></pre></div>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">        The first one is a property NaN(Not a Number), it is returned when converting any \ninvalid number(ex +“3a” will return NaN). You can also check Number.IsNaN(value), it \nreturns boolean value.\n\nThe second one is **Infinity**. This property is on global object represent numeric infinity \nSo it return **”number”** as type\n\nThe Third one is an array. When we check the typeof array, it returns object which is\ncorrect as arrays are objects in JS(not only arrays everything is object). If you want to \ncheck if an object is an array there could be different ways, one of those is using a\nmethod on Array class. **Array.isArray([1, 2, 3])**. This will return value in boolean either\n**true/false**.</code></pre></div>\n<p>What is the o/p of below code?\n<code class=\"language-text\">\n            let func = () => {};\n\ttypeof func; // “function”\n\t</code>\nWhy? “function”!!! , it should return “object” as functions are first class objects. There\nIs no such type in JS.So, the main reason to provide it is to provide some helpful\nspecification to the developers (do let me know if you find a more verbose answer).</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Types in Javascript","date":"December 04, 2021","description":"Understanding types in JS is one of the fundamental concepts.
